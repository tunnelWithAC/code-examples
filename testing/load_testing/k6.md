## Get started

[source](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/get-started/running-k6/)

Follow along to learn how to:
* Run a test.
* Add virtual users.
* Increase the test duration.
* Ramp the number of requests up and down as the test runs.

Steps:
1. Install K6. On Mac this can be done using `brew install k6`, you can find the installation instructions for Linux, Mac, and Windows [here](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/).

2. Run local tests. To run a simple local script:
Create and initialize a new script by running the following command: `k6 new`. This command creates a new script file named `script.js` in the current directory. You can also specify a different file name as an argument to the `k6 new` command, for example `k6 new my-test.js`. 

3. Then run k6 with the following command: `k6 run script.js`

4. Now run a load test with more than one virtual user and a longer duration: `k6 run --vus 10 --duration 30s script.js`

### The init context and the default function

For a test to run, you need to have init code, which prepares the test, and VU code, which makes requests.

Code in the init context defines functions and configures the test options (like `duration`).

Every test also has a `default` function, which defines the VU logic.

```
// init

export default function () {
  // vu code: do things here...
}
```

Init code runs first and is called only once per VU. The `default` code runs as many times or as long as is configured in the test options.

Instead of typing `--vus 10` and `--duration 30s` each time you run the script, you can set the options in your JavaScript file:

```
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';
export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
};
export default function () {
  http.get('http://test.k6.io');
  sleep(1);
}
```

You can ramp the number of VUs up and down during the test. To configure ramping, use the`options.stages` property.

```
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },
    { duration: '1m30s', target: 10 },
    { duration: '20s', target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://httpbin.test.k6.io/');
  check(res, { 'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200 });
  sleep(1);
}
```

## How can I configure authentication for my k6 load tests?

Authentication in k6 load tests can be configured based on the type of authentication your application uses. Here are examples for Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and Cookie-based authentication:

1. Basic Auth: If your application uses Basic Auth, you can set the Authorization header to 'Basic ' + btoa(username + ':' + password).

```
let username = 'your-username';
let password = 'your-password';
let credentials = btoa(username + ':' + password);

let res = http.get('https://example.com', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Basic ' + credentials },
});
```

2. Bearer Token: If your application uses Bearer tokens (such as JWT), you can set the Authorization header to 'Bearer ' + token.

```
let token = 'your-token';

let res = http.get('https://example.com', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token },
});
```

3. Cookie-based Authentication: If your application uses cookies for authentication, you can use the http.cookieJar() function to manage cookies.

```
let jar = http.cookieJar();
jar.set('https://example.com', 'sessionid', 'your-session-id');

let res = http.get('https://example.com');
```

In all these examples, replace 'https://example.com', 'your-username', 'your-password', and 'your-token' with your actual URL, username, password, and token.

Remember to import the http module at the start of your script:

```
import http from 'k6/http';
```

These are basic examples. Depending on your needs, you might want to handle errors, retry failed requests, or extract and use other data from the responses.

## How can I get okta access token during k6 test

To get an Okta access token during a k6 test, you can make a POST request to the Okta API's token endpoint. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  var url = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token';
  var payload = JSON.stringify({
    grant_type: 'password',
    username: '{username}',
    password: '{password}',
    scope: 'openid',
  });
  var params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('{clientId}:{clientSecret}'),
    },
  };

  let res = http.post(url, payload, params);

  check(res, {
    'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200,
    'token is present': (r) => r.json().access_token !== '',
  });

  let token = res.json().access_token;

  // Use the token in subsequent requests
  let authParams = {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token,
    },
  };

  let response = http.get('http://test.k6.io', authParams);
}
```
