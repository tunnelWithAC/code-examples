## Example Projects

* [Container](https://github.com/AwesomeYuer/grpc-dotnet-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#container) - shows how to create a gRPC Kubernetes app. There are two containers in the example: a Blazor Server frontend, and a gRPC server backend with multiple replicas. The frontend uses gRPC client-side load balancing to call backend instances.
* [Greeter](https://github.com/AwesomeYuer/grpc-dotnet-examples/tree/master/Greeter) shows how to create unary (non-streaming) gRPC methods in ASP.NET Core, and call them from a client.
* [Racer](https://github.com/AwesomeYuer/grpc-dotnet-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#racer) shows how to create a bi-directional streaming gRPC method in ASP.NET Core and call it from a client. The client and the server each send messages as quickly as possible.
* [Aggregator](https://github.com/AwesomeYuer/grpc-dotnet-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#aggregator) hows how a to make nested gRPC calls (a gRPC service calling another gRPC service). The gRPC client factory is used in ASP.NET Core to inject a client into services. The gRPC client factory is configured to propagate the context from the original call to the nested call. In this example the cancellation from the client will automatically propagate through to nested gRPC calls.
* [Liber](https://github.com/AwesomeYuer/grpc-dotnet-examples?tab=readme-ov-file#liber) shows how to add Protobuf messages to a shared .NET project. Sharing generated messages is an alternative to each project generating their own copy. Protobuf messages in a shared project makes it easier to write reusable libraries that use messages.
